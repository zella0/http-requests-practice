## HTTP Assignment
Complete the challenges below inside server.js
Postman will be a huge help with the assignment - https://www.getpostman.com/

### Challenge 1:
When a user does a GET request to "localhost:8000/intro" the server should respond with "Welcome to backend!" in plain text.

### Challenge 2:
When a user does a GET request to "localhost:8000/pets" the server should send a json response that is an array of all your pet names (if you don't have any pets make up a few names).

### Challenge 3:
When a user does a GET request to "localhost:8000/getinfo" the server should send a text response containing the text within info.txt. HINT - might need to use fs!

When a user does a POST request to "localhost:8000/count" you should add to a running total that starts at 0.

### Challenge 5:
When a user does a GET request to "localhost:8000/getcount" you should send a text response containing the current running total from challenge 4.

### Challenge 6:
